# TemperatureSensor_LM35

![Test Setup](/html/Sensor.jpg)

This is the main project directory.

You can open the project [ Projekt.cproj] (Projekt.cproj) with AVR-Studio. 

For that project I used the Atmel 90USB1287 and of course the LM35 temperature sensor.

Discription:
With the software, a temperature measurement with the sensor LM35 can be performed using a real-time operating system (RTOS). The current temperature will be displayed on a LCD display.

Open [index.html] (/html/index.html) in your browser to see the Doxygen documentation.

Please note: The comments in the code are in German, just message me if you have a question.
